## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "assets/images/rings.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Hello my name is Jason Spector! Currently, I am a Data Scientist for the Golden State Warriors. I grew up playing and watching sports and my favorite subject was statistics. I figured why not do something that involves both. While getting my Bachelor's degree at University of California, Berkeley I created and taught an Introduction to Sports Statistics Class. I then created and lectured for the University of Arizona's Sports Analytics class, which integrated the university's athletic department into the curriculum by providing real sports analytics questions solved by my students. I have turned a few of my lectures into blog posts hoping that other people might enjoy the topics as much as I did. 

It should be noted that none of my work is attached to the Golden State Warriors Basketball Operations office.

### Side Hobbies
<div class="box">
  <p>
  On the side I am a contemporary dancer and choreographer. While attending the University of Arizona, I founded Ardor Dance Company and was Artistic Director for two years. Before that I taught around the Bay Area and at Full Out Studios in Oakland for years. I was also a dancer and choreographer for Thrive Dance Company from 2012-2016. Dance is something I do in order to get creative and not so stuck in the numbers all the time. You can watch one of my pieces <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKQYB63dU6M">here.</a>
